#DRIVER CODE-- DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE (except in the section at the bottom)
# These are the tests to ensure it's working. 
# These should all print true if the method is working properly.
p bakery_num(24, "cake") == "You need to make 4 cake(s)."
p bakery_num(41, "pie") == "You need to make 5 pie(s), 0 cake(s), and 1 cookie(s)."
p bakery_num(24, "cookie") == "You need to make 24 cookie(s)."
p bakery_num(4, "pie") == "You need to make 0 pie(s), 0 cake(s), and 4 cookie(s)."
p bakery_num(130, "pie") == "You need to make 16 pie(s), 0 cake(s), and 2 cookie(s)."
# p bakery_num(3, "apples") # this will raise an ArgumentError

# You SHOULD change this driver code. Why? Because it doesn't make sense.
p bakery_num(41, "cake") == "You need to make 5 pie(s), 0 cake(s), and 1 cookie(s)." # WHAAAAAT? I thought I said I wanted cake!




#  Reflection 

# I had a very successful pairing session with Karl.  We did a good job refactoring the code
# there were a few points that we got stuck on but we were able to work past it.  I thought there was some issue with the driver code
# because the first one only lists out the cakes when the way the program is written prints out every type.  The code could be further
# improved for the first driver if for each of the types it added to the string that was returned at the end
